/**
 ** This interface must be implemented by a plugin to provide a mechanism to create screen real estate on the SWTLTab for its GUI. A plugin
 ** registers itself with the bridge using the registerPlugin method of the BridgePluginManager class. In addition to a plugin display name,
 ** a tool tip string, and an icon, this method is expecting an instance of a class that implements this interface. The plugin manager uses
 ** this implementation to get the GUI for the plugin, which will be displayed in the SWRLTab when the plugin is activated. <p>
 **
 ** The createPluginGUI method is called once when the plugin is registered and is expecting a Java Swing component that is a subclass of a
 ** Java Swing Container class. The getPluginGUI may be called repeatedly after registration and should return the Container instance
 ** created on initialization.
 **
 ** See <a href="http://protege.cim3.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?SWRLRuleEngineBridgeFAQ#nid6QJ">here</a> for a discussion on using this inferface.
