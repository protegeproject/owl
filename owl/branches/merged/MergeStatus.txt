Initial revision copied from  http://smi-protege/repos/protege/owl/trunk 
Initial Revision = 1866
Merged up to revision = 1956  But I will  need another merge...
Merge to revision = 1963
Merge to revision = 2041

Starting the merge process:
     svn cp $q/branches/nci_june15 $q/branches/merged  - revision 5935
        (q=http://smi-protege/repos/protege/owl)
        I can account for the revisions (I also removed the old
        version of merged.common) - nobody else has done anything.
     
     svn rm $q/branches/merged/$swrl - revision 5936
     svn cp $q/trunk/$swrl $q/branches/merged/$swrl - revision 5937
        (swrl=src/edu/stanford/smi/protegex/owl/swrl)

     Check out the merged branch

     The nci_june15 branch was merged to trunk@2041 so this is where I will
     start the diffs.

     svn merge $q/trunk@2041 $q/trunk@5937 .

There was no other svn activity during this process.
